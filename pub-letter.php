        <div class="grid-10 push-8 pad-mobile-20">
            <p class="first">In the media and marketing worlds, we frequently throw around a few expressions about
                content.</p>
            <p>You’ve all heard them: Be a part of the conversation. Think like a publisher. Or the one I
                really dislike: We need a content strategy. </p>
            <p>What all of those are really saying is this: We need a point of view. If you can figure out your point of
                view, you’ll be able to carve out a place in the world of digital media that will be the envy of your
                competitors.</p>
            <p>The power of point of view is not unique to digital publishing, of course. We’ve seen it define and shape
                successful magazines, newspapers and cable TV shows (hello, Fox News). But the fact that it’s now
                defining the successful digital media properties signals that digital media is approaching its golden
                age. </p>
            <p>That’s why we devoted this issue of Say Magazine to the power of what we call Point-of-View Publishing
                and the pioneers who are leading the way. In our cover story (“The Great Escape,” page xx), Dan Lyons,
                editor in chief of ReadWrite, who you also may know as an award-winning columnist and the creator of
                Fake Steve Jobs, talks about how he’s harnessing storytelling and point of view as the secret to
                covering the tech stories that really matter — and engaging readers in a two-way conversation. We’ve
                pictured him on the cover of the issue in a prison jumpsuit for fun but also to signal that you should
                expect the unexpected from Lyons’ vision for ReadWrite (and we mean that in the best way
                imaginable).</p>
            <p>Also in this issue, you'll find interviews some of the Web’s most talented — and in some cases surprising
                — storytellers (“Unusual Suspects,” page xx). These content creators are narrators of the everyday as
                well as the remarkable who use images, words or social media to engross an audience that is more
                plugged-in than ever before. Media entrepreneurs such as Kelly Framel from Glamourai, Jamie Beck of From
                Me To You, Pippa Lord of Sous Style and Emily Schuman of Cupcakes and Cashmere are strong, individual
                personalities that have cultivated significant influence, are driving the e-commerce revolution, and
                have attracted motivated and sizable loyal audiences. We’ve also created a cool map that highlights some
                of the most promising and interesting point-of-view publishers and storytellers on page xx (prepare to
                be surprised). </p>
            <p>On page xx, Jon Thomas, editor in chief of Post Advertising, takes point of view a step further in “The
                Art and Science of Great Brand Storytelling” and shows you how to unearth your own brand story. We also
                asked Brian Clark, one of the foremost experts on creating great copy to write about how to create great
                online content that builds your business (“The State of the Art in Content Marketing,” page xx). </p>
            <p>And there’s much, much more. Taken together, all these stories are a playbook for what we believe it
                takes for advertisers, content creators and all of us to be successful, relevant and competitive in this
                brave new world of digital media.</p>
