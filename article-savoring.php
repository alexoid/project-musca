                <p class="first">Amstel Light celebrates American entrepreneurs in a captivating custom video
                    campaign.</p>

                <p>In a time when most beer advertisers inundate their audience with big, bold ads that cater to the
                    lowest common denominator, it takes courage for a company to trust that the people it truly wants to
                    reach are intelligent, discerning and sophisticated, and to provide a marketing experience that's in
                    line with those beliefs. However, that is exactly what Amstel Light did when it launched their new
                    campaign entitled "<a href="http://gearpatrol.com/tag/amstel-light/" title="Savor Complexity"
                                          target="blank">Savor Complexity</a>."</p>

                <p>In an effort to encourage consumers to explore the complexities and appreciate the intricacies of
                    their own lives, Amstel Light partnered with Say Media and Gear Patrol to create a video series
                    profiling local entrepreneurs who are forging new paths in their cities in order to show the value
                    of complexity.</p>

                <p>Gear Patrol was the perfect fit for this campaign as both their readers and the creators themselves
                    have a shared passion for innovation, craftsmanship and attention to detail, and who understand that
                    taste defines the way in which one lives. It also excels at smart storytelling and were able to tie
                    in Amstel Light's brand message through authentic interview questions about creating a small
                    business like, "What complexities surprised you?"</p>


                <p>The videos lived on Gear Patrol's site as well as in online and mobile ad units targeted to Say
                    Media's extensive network, effectively reaching Amstel Light's target audience in a way it
                    appreciated, but didn't expect.</p>

                <p>Unusual advertising that's authentic, subtle and complex? We'll definitely drink to that.</p>
