                When Kelly Framel launched her personal style blog, <a href="http://www.theglamourai.com/"
                                                                       title="The Glamourai" target="blank">The
                    Glamourai</a> in 2008, she was embarrassed. At the time, she was a designer for <a
                    href="http://www.naeemkhan.com/" title="Naeem Khan" target="blank">Naeem Khan</a>. "I was
                terrified to share it with the serious, old-school stylists and industry insiders I was constantly
                working with. I thought no one in the business could possibly take me seriously if they knew I had
                this silly little blog," Framel says.</p>

            <p>But the site established Framel as a tastemaker and pushed her personal artistic boundaries.
                Eventually, it became her full-time gig. Many of the Web's best storyteller's have a similar tale —
                they experimented with something for themselves only to find an audience and an unimagined
                future.</p>

            <p>Digital storytellers come in nearly every variation — narrators of the everyday and the remarkable
                who use images, words or social media missives to engross an audience that is more plugged-in than
                ever before. In fact, the prevalence of the screen has been a boon to creatives with an eye for
                innovation. These content creators continue to drive the e-commerce revolution, motivating the sale
                of cookbooks, clothes and furniture; prescient publishers are honing a new way to cover news,
                promote long-form writing and attract an influential audience; and inventive use of new platforms is
                allowing artists of all types to distribute their work.</p>

            <h3>The Aesthetic Economy</h3>

            <p>
                <img src="_assets/unusual/hanneli-beck.jpg" class="hanneli-beck"/>

                Fashion and lifestyle media brands have been slow to adapt to the power of digital. In their stead,
                a cottage industry of strong, individual personalities has cultivated significant influence.
                Consider Framel or Jamie Beck, the photographer who's often in front of the camera on <a
                    href="http://annstreetstudio.com/" title="Ann Street Studio" target="blank">Ann Street
                    Studio</a>, or or Hanneli Mustaparta, the former model who offers candid access to her life on
                <a href="http://www.hanneli.com/" title="Hanneli.com" target="blank">Hanneli.com</a>. This breed of
                content creators is less interested in the rough, outfit-of-the-day, self-portrait-in-the-mirror
                form of style blogging than in high-gloss, thematic fashion editorials reminiscent of print
                magazines. Their sites feature shots staged in glamorous foreign locales, from the sidelines of
                Fashion Week or within warmly lit interiors.</p>

            <p>"Fashion collections have to be created at such a fast pace these days, so I was drawing a lot of my
                inspiration from the Internet, especially using personal style blogs as a barometer of trends,"
                Framel says. "Finally I decided that it might actually be fun to get in on the conversation." The
                burgeoning popularity of street style bloggers helped, creating a digital reverence for individual
                style — but the journalistic nature of their work left an opening for stylish people who wanted to
                tell their own style stories.</p>

            <p>
                <img src="_assets/unusual/sarinara-lau-medine.jpg" class="sarinara-lau-medine"/>

                Others who've mastered the artful balance between self and style include Julie Sarinana of <a
                    href="http://www.sincerelyjules.com/" title="Sincerely, Jules" target="blank">Sincerely,
                    Jules</a> who catalogs her West Coast cool daily style; Susanna Lau (aka Susie Bubble) and her
                online diary of fashionable observations and original outfits on <a
                    href="http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/" title="Style Bubble" target="blank">Style Bubble</a>; and
                Leandra Medine of <a href="http://www.manrepeller.com/" title="The Man Repeller" target="blank">The
                    Man Repeller</a>, a site that chronicles her habit of dressing "in a sartorially offensive mode
                that may result in repelling members of the opposite sex."</p>

            <p class="pad-right">As the independent fashion media began attracting influence, designers and retail
                brands gave them access once reserved for only old-media outlets. Digital fashionistas sit front row
                at Fashion Week, model in ad campaigns, forge design collaborations and make guest appearances in
                the pages of <em>Vogue</em>.</p>

            <p>How did this happen? Simple: They used their personal brands to push product. Their outfits, friends,
                travels and love lives are covered in a narrative and polished manner that offers daily inspiration
                — opposed to the catalogs of world-class models and trends that magazines offer. Plus, these
                bloggers offer an approachable level of personality, access and narration, giving fans a familiarity
                with their lives in a way that was never possible in a print product. "I've never wanted to be a
                salesperson. I want to be a storyteller," Framel says. "My job is not to report or to sell; my job
                is to inspire."</p>

            <p>
                <img src="_assets/unusual/todd-selby.jpg" class="tod-selby"/>

                For Todd Selby, building a site was just a hobby, an extension of his day job as a professional
                photographer specializing in portraits and fashion photography for magazines and advertisers.
                Growing restless waiting for assignments and inspired by the living spaces of his creative friends
                and assigned subjects, he launched <a href="http://theselby.com/" title="The Selby" target="blank">The
                    Selby</a> in 2008.</p>

            <p>The conceit is simple: gorgeous photographs of supremely interesting interiors. But the result is
                striking. With images of knickknack collections, stacked art supplies and intimate portraits of
                people in their homes — as well as a hand-drawn questionnaire denouement to each post — The Selby
                manages to capture the spirit of a person's life with objects. "I just really wanted to do this cool
                thing and put it on the Internet," Selby says. "Working online is the way to do things. It's global,
                and it's instantaneous, and it's forever."</p>

            <p>The site has been an unparalleled calling card for Selby, who supports himself by working on
                advertising collaborations. He has produced a <a href="http://louisvuittonexpress.com/"

                hand-drawn infographics to personal essays to poems — authored primarily by outside contributors.
                Few topics are typical, but the content is instead united by a sense of offbeat identity that

                long-form journalism. <a href="http://therumpus.net/" title="The Rumpus" target="blank">The

                on pop culture, humor and essays to create a well-honed sense of editorial style. As well, ESPN’s

            <p>Readership of The Awl swelled to about half a million visitors by the fall of 2010. Eventually, the
                site was making enough money to support its staff and spin-off sites devoted to women’s interests
                (<a href="http://thehairpin.com/" title="The Hairpin" target="blank">The Hairpin</a>), money (<a

                    href="http://thewirecutter.com/" title="The Wirecutter" target="blank">The Wirecutter</a>) have
                launched since. "We think whatever happens from here on out is gravy," Sicha says. "Largely, we’re
                surprised it’s been around this long already. We didn’t have a business strategy."</p>

            <p>Being a nimble and relatively niche site allowed The Awl some wiggle room when it came to making
                money. With clearly distinguishable readers and a knack for catering content for them, The Awl has
                created advertising products that mesh relatively seamlessly with the rest of the site’s content —
                an approach that serves both readers and advertisers. They created a commercial for Newcastle Brown
                Ale that was cross-promoted on posts and a <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/12/hitchin-a-ride-1/"

                friends around. </p>

            <p>Out of the rise of mobile and creative moneymaking has come a trend of micropublishing. <a
                    href="https://www.byliner.com/" title="Byliner" target="blank">Byliner</a>, a consortium of
                well-known editors and writers, publishes articles and essays that cost a few dollars each. If you

            <p>Meanwhile, long-form writing is having a bit of resurgence online via smaller publishers. Many have
                used <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" title="Kickstarter" target="blank">Kickstarter</a>
                campaigns to raise initial funds and are staffed by seasoned journalists. <a
                    href="https://www.readmatter.com/" title="MATTER" target="blank">MATTER</a> collected nearly
                three times its fundraising goal of $50,000 and published its first story (available for $.99) in
                November. <a href="http://narrative.ly/" title="Narratively" target="blank">Narratively</a>, funded
                by a $54,000 Kickstarter haul, publishes a new story about New York City every day. But the most
                heralded publication is probably <a href="http://www.tomorrowthemag.com/" title="Tomorrow"
                                                    target="blank">Tomorrow</a>, a one-off magazine founded by the
                eight <a href="http://www.good.is/everyone" title="Good Magazine" target="blank">Good Magazine</a>
                staff members who were laid off in June. </p>

            <p>The former Good-ers were determined to turn the turn of fate into inspiration for something of
                creative substance. In less than three weeks, they hatched an idea for a new publication, raised
                enough money to finance it and were digging through hundreds of pitches from willing writers and
                offers to help them design the issue and fact-check the features.</p>

            <p>The process was apparently simple. After being unceremoniously canned, the staffers asked for $15,000
                via a Kickstarter campaign. Less than five hours later, they met their fundraising goal. Of course,
                it helped that several of the staffers were relatively well-known, with large Twitter, Tumblr and
                industry followings thanks to their previous work. "I think people supported the project because
                they supported us. The content was an ancillary benefit," says editor Ann Friedman. A total of 1,779
                people contributed $45,452 during the month-long campaign.</p>

            <p>The relative success of the project has sbeen celebrated as a beacon and an example of the sort of
                future that's possible for storytellers in the digital age. But the reality is a little more
                complicated — Friedman says they ended up breaking even; to make a profit that would allow the
                project to be sustainable, they would have had to raise at least eight times their initial
                fundraising goal.</p>

            <p>There’s no guarantee that what works now will work in the future or that brilliant ideas can be
                sustainable. Internet video is rumored to be the next big thing, native advertising promises to
                revive a sagging digital economy, and storytellers will continue to be challenged with
                entrepreneurialism. "I don’t think there’s one solution. That’s precisely why it’s exciting,"
                Friedman says. "What you’re seeing is a lot of possibilities."</p>
