            <p>Customers could select from several customized endings to the video story, ensuring that they would spend time with the experience. Meanwhile, roaches crawling in and out of the screen were a hit with the target demographic. With its interactive interface, celebrity star power and rich media, the ad drove high engagement â€” three and half times the benchmark average click-thru rate.</p>
            <p>The popular and well-designed campaign garnered a prestigious <a href="http://saydaily.com/2012/10/say-media-takes-2-omma-awards-at-advertising-week.html" title="OMMA Award" target="blank">OMMA Award</a> for Online Advertising Creativity, which honors advertisers that push the potential of online advertising creative. Unfortunately, we didn't capture high scores on roach-smashing, but it definitely added to the fun.</p>
