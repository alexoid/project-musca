            <p>Zoo York apparel embodies the attitude and lifestyle of the Big Apple’s skateboarding, graffiti and hip-hop community. To showcase its brand, the company put together an irreverent and engaging interactive experience, highlighting the clothing company’s latest styles.</p>
            <p>Starring supermodel and actress Kate Upton and a couple of cockroaches with attitude, the campaign included videos, rich media and social sharing. Created on <a href="#">Say Media’s AdFrames 3 platform</a>, the ad unit featured a series of “choose your own ending” videos starring Upton as well as an embedded “smash-a-roach” challenge and a “lookbook” of the company’s current line.</p>

            <p>Customers could select from several customized endings to the video story, ensuring that they would spend time with the experience. Meanwhile, roaches crawling in and out of the screen were a hit with the target demographic. With its interactive interface, celebrity star power and rich media, the ad drove high engagement — three and half times the benchmark average click-thru rate.</p>
            <p>The popular and well-designed campaign garnered a prestigious OMMA Award for Online Advertising Creativity, which honors advertisers that push the potential of online advertising creative. Unfortunately, we didn’t capture high scores on roach-smashing, but it definitely added to the fun.</p>
