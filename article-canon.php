            <div class="content-rail ">
                <p class="first">Canon and Say Media created an original content series around one editor's passion for
                    photography.</p>

                <p>With the advent of smartphones and apps such as Instagram, photography instantly became much more
                    accessible than ever before. Suddenly everyone had a camera in hand (or pocket) at all times and
                    documenting the minute details of life became the status quo. But for many, the camera phone or the
                    point-and-shoot just weren’t enough. Not everyone was willing to sacrifice quality for
                    convenience.</p>

                <p>To reach those discerning consumers, Canon partnered with Say Media and Gear Patrol to <a
                        href="http://gearpatrol.com/tag/sharp-shooter/" title="create a campaign" target="blank">create
                        a campaign</a> to show aspiring photographers that, in fact, there’s no need to sacrifice
                    quality or convenience. Canon wanted to demonstrate that DSLR cameras are easier to use than ever —
                    while also teaching consumers how to shoot smarter and better.</p>
            </div>


                <?php include "../inc/social.php"; ?>

        </div>

    <section class="content">
        <div class="grid">

            <div class="outbox-right">
                <img src="_assets/canon/eric.jpg">
            </div>
            <div class="content-rail-narrow">




                <p>Gear Patrol was the perfect site to help Canon’s campaign come into focus. A significant portion of
                    the site’s readers are both novice and experienced photographers who trust the Gear Patrol editors
                    for tips and advice on what to buy and why. Gear Patrol captured readers’ attention by providing
                    them with knowledge about DSLR cameras and lenses as well as a series on how to most effectively
                    shoot using Canon DSLRs in different situations, including urban locations and at night.</p>


                <p>The posts lived on Gear Patrol’s site alongside high-impact, interactive ad units targeted to Say
                    Media’s extensive network. As a result, photographers of all types were able to learn more about
                    Canon’s DSLR offerings while also learning more about how to be a better photographer. Ultimately,
                    the entire experience felt less like an ad and more like valuable content. An engaging photo gallery
                    created by the editors increased time spent on the site relative to the consumer electronics
                    benchmark.</p>

                <p>A successful ad that benefits both the client and the consumer? Now that’s a picture worth
                    capturing.</p>
